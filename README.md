##ROVER: Rating Overlays for Virtual Environments in Research

![Overview of the ROVER rating station.](https://github.com/kuentzel/ROVER/ROVER_Overview)

ROVER is a tool and software development kit to enable researchers with a limited IT background to easily integrate immersive rating scales and questionnaires into their VR user experience studies.
ROVER uses the SteamVR Overlay Interface together with the OpenVR Compositor Interface to project 2D content over the 3D Virtual Environment.
ROVER has been evaluated as part of a user experience pilot study in collaboration with health psychologists. The research paper is open access and will be linked here upon puplication.
