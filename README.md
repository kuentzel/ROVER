ROVER is a Virtual Reality / VR questionnaire toolkit to enable researchers with a limited IT background to easily integrate immersive rating scales and questionnaires into their VR user experience studies.

ROVER uses the SteamVR Overlay Interface together with the OpenVR Compositor Interface to project 2D content over the 3D Virtual Environment.

ROVER has been evaluated as part of a user experience pilot study in collaboration with health psychologists.

The research paper introducing the tool is open access and can be found here: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3660515.3661328.
Other research using ROVER is listed below.

## Download

ROVER is meant to be used as a standalone executable. It does not need to be and is not meant to be integrated into your own project.
ROVER can be downloaded here: https://github.com/kuentzel/ROVER/releases/tag/v2408r1

You can download more sample questionnaires (Usability Metric for User Experience, System Usability Scale, NASA Task Load Index, igroup Presence Questionnaire, etc.) here: https://github.com/kuentzel/ROVER/releases/tag/qp1

## Getting Started
1. Download ROVER: https://github.com/kuentzel/ROVER/releases/tag/v2406r2
2. Read README_ROVER.txt
3. Configure ROVER
4. Start ROVER
5. Load sample survey
6. Explore

You are welcome to contribute and we will review any pull-requests (commit to the development branch).
Feel free to open an issue at https://github.com/kuentzel/ROVER/issues> or contact us at kuentzel@hochschule-trier.de

## Planned Updates

- Graphical User Interface / Web App for easy Survey/Questionnaire Configuration (feel free to reach out if you require assistance) -> Q1 2025
- Improvement and expansion of the graphical desktop UI to cover the configuration option currently set via the text files -> Q4 2024
- Improved guide on setting up and using ROVER (feel free to reach out if you require assistance) -> Q4 2024
- Cleaned-up and improved item layouts, more item types (images, sliders, etc.) -> Q1 2025
