ROVER is a Virtual Reality / VR questionnaire toolkit to enable researchers with a limited IT background to easily integrate immersive rating scales and questionnaires into their VR user experience studies.

ROVER uses the SteamVR Overlay Interface together with the OpenVR Compositor Interface to project 2D content over the 3D Virtual Environment.

ROVER has been evaluated as part of a user experience pilot study in collaboration with health psychologists.

The research paper introducing the tool is open access and can be found here: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3660515.3661328.

ROVER is meant to be used as a standalone executable. It does not need to be and is not meant to be integrated into your own project.
ROVER can be downloaded here: https://github.com/kuentzel/ROVER/releases/tag/v2406r2

You can download more sample questionnaires (Usability Metric for User Experience, System Usability Scale, NASA Task Load Index, igroup Presence Questionnaire, etc.) here: https://github.com/kuentzel/ROVER/releases/tag/qp1

The code is provided to enable individual adjustments and builds. ROVER has been developed using Unity 2021.3.x.

ROVER has several dependencies: SteamVR Unity Plugin, OpenVR, OpenVR Unity XR Plugin, Ready Player Me, ManagedRenderEvent. These dependencies have been released open source. Find their respective licenses in the License file. ROVER comes with all dependencies.
